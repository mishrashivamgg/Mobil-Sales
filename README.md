**1.Project Objective:**
This dashboard appears to be designed to provide a high-level overview of mobile sales performance, likely for a specific period (potentially Month-to-Date, given the "MTD Report" label)
**Key Components:**

Total Sales: A prominent display of the total sales figure for the period, currently showing 769M.
Transaction: Indicates the total number of transactions that occurred during the period, currently at 4K.
Total Quantity: Shows the total number of mobile units sold, which is 19K.
Avg Price: Displays the average selling price per unit, currently at 40.11K.

**Charts and Visualizations:**

Total Sales by Month: A line graph showcasing the sales trend over the months of the year.
Total Sales by Mobile Model: A bar chart highlighting the sales performance of different mobile models.
Transaction ID by Payment Method: A pie chart illustrating the distribution of transactions across various payment methods (UPI, Debit Card, Credit Card, Cash).
Total Sales by Day Name: A line graph depicting sales trends across different days of the week.
Filters:

Mobile Model: Allows users to filter the data by specific mobile models.
Payment Method: Enables filtering based on the payment method used in transactions.
Brand: Offers the option to filter data by the brand of the mobile devices.

**Additional Information:**

MTD Report: Likely refers to a Month-to-Date report, summarizing the sales performance for the current month.
Same Period Last Year: Presumably, this section would compare the current period's sales figures with those from the same period in the previous year.

**Filters:**

Mobile Model: Allow users to filter data by specific mobile models.
Payment Method: Enable filtering based on the payment method used in transactions.
Year, Quarter, Month Name: Provide options to filter data by year, quarter, and month.
**Slicers:**

Create slicers for Mobile Model, Payment Method, Year, Quarter, and Month to allow users to interactively filter data.
Functionality:

Drill-down capabilities: Enable users to drill down into specific segments of the data, such as individual models or payment methods.
Data highlighting: Allow users to highlight specific data points or segments for further analysis.
Cross-filtering: Enable cross-filtering between different visualizations to explore relationships between data.
